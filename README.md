# ExtraCells3-1.7.10

Major rework of ExtraCells2 library. This fork is targeting gregtech-centered modpacks. 

- All dependencies (opencomputers,thaumcraft, mekanism) were removed. 
- Gas and all items that were interacting with gas were removed.
- Removed some blocks and parts temporarily because thay had too much legacy code that is very hard to maintain.
  They will be added later.
- Major rework of inventories, containers, guis etc. Now inventories are much more reliable and friendly.
